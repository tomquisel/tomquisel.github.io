Hi there! I'm Tom. I'm an expert in machine learning and large-scale data analysis. I have a BS from Carnegie Mellon in Computer Science and 10+ years of experience in the software industry.

I first worked at [OkCupid](https://www.okcupid.com), growing from a Software Engineering role to leading the technology team as OkCupid's Chief Technology Officer. In my technical capacity, I redesigned OkCupid's core matching algorithm and helped build its scalable infrastructure (see my talk on it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx6cWL4vIvU) and [this Narratively article](http://narrative.ly/the-code-of-love/)).  In my leadership capacity I focused on servant leadership, creating a culture of trust & ownership, and making great hires while encouraging diversity. I'm especially proud of OkCupid's advocacy and [vocal support](http://time.com/44531/okcupid-firefox-mozilla-gay-rights/) for gay, trans, and minority groups.

I then dove back into my passion for machine learning and took on a Data Science role at [Evidation Health](http://www.evidation.com/). I did [Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) and worked on improving healthcare through better targeting of treatments and understanding of patient health.

I'm a co-creator of [StellarX](https://www.stellarx.com), a crypto-asset marketplace built on the Stellar network. I'm currently working as an engineering manager at Interstellar, focusing on StellarX, and helping to bring about a more inclusive and open future for fintech.

On the side I do angel investing, work on [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/), collaborate with the amazing startup community here in Santa Barbara, and do what I can to contribute to important problems for humanity such as [human longevity]({{site.baseurl}}/longevity-research-overview/).

Outside of work, I love going outdoors to hike, bike, run, and practice acroyoga or heading to a local coffee shop to learn more about our world through Coursera, TED Talks, and research papers.
