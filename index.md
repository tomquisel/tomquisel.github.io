Hi there! I'm Tom. I'm a passionate technology executive who's held leadership roles at three $1B+ software companies. I have a BS from Carnegie Mellon in Computer Science and 15 years of experience in the software industry.

I first worked at [OkCupid](https://www.okcupid.com), growing from a Software Engineering role to leading the technology team as OkCupid's Chief Technology Officer. In my technical capacity, I redesigned OkCupid's core matching algorithm and helped build its scalable infrastructure (see my talk on it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx6cWL4vIvU) and [this Narratively article](http://narrative.ly/the-code-of-love/)). In my leadership capacity I focused on servant leadership, creating a culture of trust & ownership, and making great hires while encouraging diversity. I'm especially proud of OkCupid's advocacy and [vocal support](http://time.com/44531/okcupid-firefox-mozilla-gay-rights/) for gay, trans, and minority groups.

I then dove back into my passion for machine learning and took on a Data Science role at [Evidation Health](http://www.evidation.com/). I did [Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) and worked on improving healthcare through better targeting of treatments and understanding of patient health.

I'm currently the VP of Engineering at the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://www.stellar.org), where I spend most of my time helping the amazing people there be as happy and effective as possible. SDF is working to bring about a more inclusive and open future for the financial system, and I'm honored to play a role in that.

On the side I do angel investing, work on [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/), collaborate with the amazing startup community here in Santa Barbara, and do what I can to contribute to important problems for humanity such as [human longevity]({{site.baseurl}}/longevity-research-overview/).

Outside of work, I love going outdoors to hike, bike, run, and practice acroyoga or heading to a local coffee shop to learn more about our world through Coursera, TED Talks, and research papers.
