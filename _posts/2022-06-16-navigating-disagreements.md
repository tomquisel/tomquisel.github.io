# Navigating Disagreements as a Leader

I started leading the engineering team at OkCupid early in my career at the age of 24, after working for 3 years as a Software Engineer. It was an incredible opportunity to be given so much responsibility at that stage, but it came with many new challenges. Disagreements in a professional setting were particularly new territory for me, and I found a variety of conversations ranging from giving feedback to salary negotiations to disagreeing about software design pretty uncomfortable.

In one memorable case, OkCupid’s databases were rapidly filling up and slowing down as the app grew. We had to act quickly to avoid a total meltdown. Instead, I ended up locked in a weeks-long disagreement with my head of infrastructure about the best approach. I knew I was right, but I just couldn’t get him to budge. I carefully explained the logic to him in depth. I pointed to the data, but I just couldn’t make progress. He explained his approach, but I just didn’t think it met the requirements. In the end I pulled rank and made the decision for him, a move that would have a lasting negative impact on our relationship and go down on my mental scorecard as a serious leadership failure on my part.

Looking back, I was tragically naive. The conversation wasn’t really about finding the best technical decision, it was about meeting deeper needs in the human psyche.

Here are some tips I wish I’d heard as a new leader.

### 1. Everything is easier if you already have a good relationship

All the techniques in the world for having a productive conversation won’t matter if the other person doesn’t feel safe and respected. By the same token, if the other person feels kinship with you, they’ll be more likely to assume the best even if you bungle your delivery in the conversation.

For this reason, I believe the most important responsibility of a leader is to build strong relationships with the people on their team and create an environment of psychological safety.

### 2. Show up with the right mindset

Your mindset will subconsciously impact the flow of the conversation. Take some time beforehand to set the framing of the conversation in your mind. The best footing is to view yourself and the other person as two people with needs, wants, and desires that are equally important. You may be representing your company in the conversation, but this does not make your need more important. If you place a high value on their needs, they’ll do the same for you and your company. You’ll find collaborative and creative solutions that work and feel far better than simply telling people what to do.

Look at the conversation as a collaboration between two equals with the goal of resolving shared issues. Set the intention of “getting on the same side of the issue.”[1]

### 3. Be strategic about timing and context

Have difficult 1:1 conversations in private. This helps to establish psychological safety.

For discussing incidents that are highly public or that involve many people (the classic example is an outage), a Blameless Post Mortem will be more productive than a private conversation. 

Be mindful of the time when you approach someone for a difficult conversation. Assess how long your conversation will take, and make sure you have enough time. If a person is under exceptional stress, has an urgent need to deal with, or is distracted, wait until they have more headspace.

That said, waiting too long can be a signal of importance to the other party. If they said something hurtful last week and you bring it up this week, it signals that it’s a big deal. It appears that you may have been thinking about it for a whole week. For this reason, discussing issues sooner is generally better. Being strategic doesn’t mean waiting for the perfect time.

In a work or relationship context, having a regular standing meeting time reduces the unsettling impact of an unexpected 1:1 showing up on the calendar.

Bringing up issues early, often, and in a supportive way can make them feel easy and casual. Small issues are often best dealt with using a quick, relaxed conversation. Bigger issues will need more time and setup.

### 4. Make the conversation opt-in

Get consent before starting. You can ask if it’s a good time to discuss an issue and suggest that you’re also happy to discuss at another time that week if it’s better for them. This reduces the feeling that they have to say “yes” to discussing now.

### 5. Set the stage

Create a warm, inviting space by sincerely sharing something that you admire about the person or about how they handled the situation you’re going to bring up. Acknowledge their effort.

You can also emphasize shared goals or context. For example, “we’ve both been in a tough situation with the shorthanded team recently” or “I know we’re both really passionate about releasing the product on time, and we’re working hard to hit that goal.”

### 6. Begin with curiosity

You’ve likely misunderstood the situation, their intentions, or even their actions. Bring up the topic in a non-judgemental way and then listen to them with genuine curiosity. Practice active listening by paraphrasing what they’ve shared. You can tell you’re succeeding at listening rather than telling if you hear them say “that’s right” not “you’re right”.[2]

By listening first, you accomplish several goals:

* You can correct any of your own misunderstandings. This alone may resolve the issue.
* People need to feel heard before they listen to you.
* If they get an opportunity to bring up the issue first, then they may take ownership of the issue. 
* Once you understand how they think about the issue, you can get your point across more effectively.

### 7. Customize

Some people are more sensitive and need only the slightest mention of a piece of feedback to fully internalize it. Others have a harder time hearing feedback or lack the context and will benefit from a more thorough discussion. Knowing your audience can make the conversation much easier.

One approach I like for delivering feedback is to progress in stages from a gentle nudge to a full explicit statement of the issue and its implications. I stop as soon as the message is received. This avoids being too heavy-handed with someone sensitive, which can feel insulting.

### 8. Share your desires non-judgmentally

People may magnify the seriousness of an issue or take it personally. If the issue isn’t a big deal, emphasize that. Try bringing up the issue in a quick and light-hearted way.

When more detail is necessary, Non-Violent Communication (NVC) is a great way to phrase your desires. It avoids “you” statements and accusations, sticking to what you’ve observed and how it affects you.

Other ways to keep it non-judgemental:

* Avoid interpreting their behavior and making assumptions. Instead, ask them about their intentions.
* Focus on what can be changed going forward and avoid dredging up past events.
* Keep the conversation to the current issue rather than broadening it to other issues.

### 9. Include them in problem solving

Ask them how to prevent the issue going forward. The key word there is ‘ask’ as telling them how to change their behavior can create conflict. They’ll feel a sense of ownership if they choose how to move forward. They’ll likely come up with ideas you hadn’t thought of, which can help you learn. If it doesn’t seem like they’re coming up with strong solutions, offer suggestions.

### 10. De-escalation
Sometimes a conversation will get heated. When this happens, pause and take a step back. Anger means that one or both of you isn’t really able to listen, and so the conversation won’t be productive. A few things you can do:
If you’re triggered, slow down your reaction time to what they say and your breathing. For example, try Box Breathing.
If they’re triggered, you can mirror what they’re saying [3] or use the “taking the wind out of their sails approach” described in Feeling Good [4].
Ask for a pause. This can be a minute of silence in the room, a ten minute walk, or waiting until tomorrow to resume discourse.

### 11. Check in
Ask them to see if they feel heard and understood. Is anything coming up for them that they’d like to share? Confirm both of your agreed-upon action items for changing things going forward.
### 10. Follow up

If the issues have improved down the road, recognize that, and express your appreciation to them. If not, talk with them about how to course-correct.
